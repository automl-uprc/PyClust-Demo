# PyClust-Demo
 
## Overview
PyClust is a tool that enables model search, meta-learning and evaluation tools for clustering. 

- **Meta Learning** : Use one of the pretrained meta-learners for algorithm selection or train your own based on a rich 
set of state-of-the art meta-features.

- **Model Search**: Out of the box grid search implementation with easy to define parameter space in the graphical 
interface 46 Cluster validity indices as developed in the pyclustkit library. 


## Requirements

The demo is based upon certain python libraries which are listed in the requirements.txt file. 
It is basically built on

- gradio

The main software needed are:

- Docker
- Python 3.10
